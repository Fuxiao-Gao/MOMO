## Intro
This is a full stack social media application created using React, Tailwind and Sanity. 

## what I learnt
1. basic react functions and syntax(before this I was using vanilla js)
2. how to connect sanity backend to the react frontend
3. google authentication; user log in and log out
4. routing and redirecting
5. using search query for sanity backend

## what I found to be the most difficult
1. changing and setting states
2. writing queries using the sanity library
